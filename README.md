TripleThreat is a [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/) mods collection of a lot of different mods that I enjoy in my playthroughs.

TripleThreat relies on [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) for mod loading

For this pack to work properly on a server you must have the same modlist on the server side and client side. Also I do not know for sure if configs sync on client joins will update later.

##Installation

Please do not try to install this pack manualy unless you know what you're doing.

Alternatively you can use [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) to install the pack with dependencies

There is no Linux or Mac support, but it is unknown if this works on either of those options, if you try it let me know in [on GitHub](https://github.com/893203/TripleThreat/issues)

##Known Issues

Custom Sail keybind usually needs to be changed for it to work properly

Before [Add All Fuel And Ore For Smelter Charcoalkiln Etc](#add-all-fuel-and-ore-for-smelter-charcoalkiln-etc) works you need to press F6 while in game. It is also recommended you go through the config to allow it to work at all times.

##Compatability

As of right now not much is known please let me know in [on GitHub](https://github.com/893203/TripleThreat/issues) 

*The mod Crafting with containers is unusable in this pack and will break your installation
*If you want to use Valhiem Plus you need to disable custom tool tips to be able to read Epic Loot enchants
